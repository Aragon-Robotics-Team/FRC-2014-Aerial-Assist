This repository contains all code used by Aragon Robotics Team 840 for the 2014 FRC game, Aerial Assist.
Not all files present in the repo are used in the final design.
Please defer to each file's first comment for its purpose.

Coders' Rules:
1. Add a comment detailing what you did and which files you modified in each commit. If using a public computer (or any device without your name and email) please sign you name in the commit
2. Create a separate commit for each separate task. Commits can contain multiple files, yet should not contain multiple fixes/edits
3. When making files with the intent of splicing them into the final code, create small and specific files
4. Place a block comment at the top of each file explaining its purpose, citing its main contributors (if they are needed for questions regarding the code), and listing any function/variable/constants/libraries it needs
5. Push often
6. Keep code clear and readable (for now...)
7. No pointers!
8. Stay classy
9001. NO KITTEN COMMENTS!
